# EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks

- There are two main achievements in this paper: 
    - 1. A new scaling method for CNNs
    - 2. A new CNN architecture called EfficientNet
- **EfficientNet** uses a compound scaling method that balances model's depth, width, and resolution in a principled way to improve accuracy and efficiency.
