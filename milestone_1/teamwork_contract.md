# Teamwork contract
rubric={reasoning:2, writing:2}

Please create a teamwork contract. This document will govern your working relationship and you are encouraged to design it to manage and resolve any issues that arise in group work. 

A teamwork contract communicates specifically how the core group of people who are working together and gives more detail about the logisitics of working together and the expectations you have for each other. Some aspects of the team work contract could be:

- How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
- What are the expected work hours for the project?
- How often will group meetings occur?
- How will you manage online meetings? What technology will you use? Please provide a description of your *online collaboration* plan. (*See last paragraph in this section*).
- Will you have meeting agendas and minutes?
- What will be the style of working?
- Will you use daily "stand-ups", or submit a written summaries of your contributions, or something else?
- What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?
- When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).
- Will you have someone who acts as the project manager (i.e. keeps things on track) for the entire project, or each milestone, or be entirely democratic throughout the project?
- Is there any behaviour you wish to highlight as being expected or unacceptable (i.e., what is the code of conduct for the group?)
- And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.
