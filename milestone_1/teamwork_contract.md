# Teamwork contract

### Team Members

- Bingyang Hou
- Jae Ihn

### How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?

- We will hold meetings to assign sections to each team member. 

### What are the expected work hours for the project?

- As much as needed to produce a reasonable result (without sacrificing mental/physical health).

### How often will group meetings occur?

- Short meetings on Tuesday to decide what we're doing for the upcoming week. 
- Meetings on Friday to check on working progress and update plans if necessary. 
- Meetings on Sunday for wrap up, putting everything together.

### How will you manage online meetings? What technology will you use? Please provide a description of your *online collaboration* plan. 

- We will mainly communicate via group Slack channel.
- Online meetings will be held through Slack huddles. 

### What will be the style of working?

- Mostly remote, unless we have two people working on the same section, sometimes we will switch to on-site collaboration. 

#### GitHub Code of Conduct

- Workflow
  - Checkout from the `main` or other teammate's branch
  - Work in your individual branch
  - Create pull request, have another teammate review and accept
    - CHECK THAT YOU DID NOT TOUCH previous milestone folders. 
    - Do not `git add .`, choose and pick which files you commit.  
  - Write a meaningful name for the pull request 
  - NEVER work directly on the `main` branch
- Branches
  - Personal branches
  - Branch for each milestone
- Commit messages
  - `{person} {action word} {filename} {month-day}` -- `JAE Update teamwork_contract.md 0331`

### Will you use daily "stand-ups", or submit a written summaries of your contributions, or something else?

- We will have a running to-do list pinned on Slack. 
- We will have regular check-ins on Slack, where we share our working progress. 

### What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?

- We want to produce end results that we are proud of, but more importantly, we want to gain a learning experience while respecting each other's boundaries. 

### When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).

- Team members are free to excuse themselves when there are time conflicts, as long as they negotiate through Slack beforehand. 

### Will you have someone who acts as the project manager (i.e. keeps things on track) for the entire project, or each milestone?

- Project manager - Jae Ihn 

### Is there any behaviour you wish to highlight as being expected or unacceptable?

- Teammates are expected to respect each other 
- Teammates are expected to show up meetings 
- Teammates are expected to tell the team in advance, in case of time conflicts
- Teammates are expected to maintain transparency about their working progress
- It is unacceptable to not respond (24-hours)
