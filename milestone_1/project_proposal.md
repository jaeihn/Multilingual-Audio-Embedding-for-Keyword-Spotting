# Project proposal
rubric={reasoning:5,writing:2}

Describe your proposed project. Your should include the following information and anything else you deem relevant:

### *Introduction:* 
- Where you introduce the task/problem you will work on. This answers the question: ``What is the nature of the task?`` (e.g., sentiment analysis, machine translation, language generation, style transfer, etc.?). Please explain ``what the task entails`` (e.g., taking in as input a sequence of text from a source language and turning it into a sequence of sufficiently equivalent meaning in target language). 
### *Data:*
- What kind of ``data`` will you be using? ``Describe the corpus``: genre, size, language, style, etc. Do you have the data? Will you acquire the data? How? Where will you ``store`` your data? 
### *Engineering:*
- What ``computing infrastructure`` will you use? Personal computers? Google Colab? Google Cloud TPUs?
- What ``deep learning of NLP (DL-NLP)`` methods will you employ? For example, will you do ``text classification with BERT?``, ``MT with T5``, ``language generation with transformers``, etc.? 
- ``Framework`` you will use. Note: You *must* use PyTorch. Identify any ``existing codebase`` you can start off with. Provide links.
### *Previous Works (minimal):*
- Refer to one or more projects that people have carried out that may be somewhat relevant to your project. This will later be expanded to some form of ``literature review``. For the sake of the proposal, this can be very brief. You are encouraged to refer to previous work here as a way to alert you to benefiting from existing projects. Provide links to any such projects.
### *Evaluation:*
- How will you ``evaluate`` your system? For example, if you are going to do MT, you could evaluate in ``BLEU``. For text classification, you can use ``accuracy`` and ``macro F1`` score. If your projects involves some interpretability, you could use ``visualization`` as a vehicle of deriving insights (and possibly some form of ``accuracy`` as approbriate).
### *Conclusion (optional):*
- You can have a very brief conclusion just summarizing the goal of the proposal. (2-3 sentences max).

### Writing:
* Again, pay attention to writing mechanics and use .md format.
